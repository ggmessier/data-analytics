# Geoff Messier's Data Analytics Repository

This repository contains (hopefully) generally useful data analytics code as well as code specifically used to generate the results I've published in peer-reviewed papers.  You can find more information on [my website](https://lib.engineer).

### Code for Publications

- The work listed here that utilizes information from emergency shelter and/or housing program databases are governed by certificates issued through the University of Calgary [ethics review process](https://research.ucalgary.ca/conduct-research/ethics-compliance).  It is typically not possible for me to publish these datasets due to privacy restrictions.  However, I still do publish the code that processes this data to demonstrate our methodology.

- Most of my analysis is done using the python [pandas](pandas.pydata.org), [numpy](numpy.org), [scipy](www.scipy.org), [matplotlib](matplotlib.org) and [plotly](plot.ly) libraries.  I will also make use of [Jupyter](jupyter.org) python notebooks.  When I use notebooks, I will post both the notebook file and a PDF export of the file for those who want to see general methodology as well as the plots I generate for the papers.


The following is the list of publications with corresponding source directories:

1. Messier, G. G., Tutty, L. and John, C., "Using Homeless Emergency Shelter Data to Identify Clients for Support Programs" [(source directory)](pubs/shelter-data-client-id).

### Miscellaneous Code

- I have some practice code that uses both [synthetic data](fake-data) and [baseball data](baseball) from  [Retrosheet](retrosheet.org) (a really great database for playing around).

- Support routines for all machine learning code are located in the [lib](lib) directory.
