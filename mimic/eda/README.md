# MIMIC Exploratory Data Analysis

Each of these notebooks opens one of the MIMIC data files and provides some explanation and EDA for each of the table data features.  The directory also contains a [useful diagram](./MIMIC%20Database%20Diagram.pdf) of the MIMIC tables but the primary keys (indicated in bold) aren't always correct.
